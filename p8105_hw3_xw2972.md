Question 1 This dataset contains 2,595,176 observations and 7 variables,
with weather data recorded across different stations in New York State.
The variables are: id, date, prcp(precipitation), snow(snow fall),
snwd(snow depth), tmax, tmin. A significant portion of the dataset
contains missing values, particularly in the tmax, tmin, prcp , snow,
and snwd. This might occur due to incomplete records, or days without
precipitation and snow. These missing values could limit the scope of
analysis. For snowfall, what are the most commonly observed values is 0,
this is due to typical weather patterns in New York State, where days
without snow are frequent. The temperatures are significantly higher in
July compared to January. There is one station that has average max
temperature lower than 10 degrees in January, which seems like an
outlier.

Question 2 Chart A: Age Distribution by Education Level and Sex chart
shows that younger individuals predominantly fall into the “More than
high school” category, it suggests that educational attainment has
improved over time. Chart B: People who’s education less than high
school tends to have more total activity than people who’s education
more than high school during thier young age. Chart C: People with More
than high school education show higher activity levels during usual
commute time.

Question 3 The combined dataset shows 99485 obs with 9 variables. The
total_rides_table shows that members ride more than casual customers.
People also tend to ride more in July compared to January in both 2020
and 2024. According to Median Ride Duration by Day of the Week, Month,
and Year chart, the median ride duration is longer in weekends than
weekdays in both 2020 and 2024. According to Ride Duration Distribution
by Membership, Month, and Bike Type (2024) chart, casual customers have
longer ride duration.
